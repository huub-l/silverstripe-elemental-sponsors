## Requirements

* dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental ^5
* dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-baseobject ^5
* symbiote/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions ^4

## Installation

`composer require dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-sponsors`

## License

See [License](LICENSE.md)

## Upgrading from version 4

This module drops `gorriecoe/silverstripe-linkfield` usage in favor of `silverstripe/linkfield`.

## Usage

A block that allows you to display multiple sponsors. Each sponsor can have a Title, Link, Image and Description. By default, the layout only shows the Image or Title with a link wrapped around it (if it's added).

An example enhancement would be to hookup a carousel to scroll through the sponsors instead of having multiple rows.
